# 🏗️ Elixilift [WIP]

This is a working in progress aplication to build an Elixir powered multi-process application to simulate a lift application, capable of executing different type of lift algorithms, as well as many lifts operating at the same time.

To start, it will only be developed the server application, with the client application being developed some time in the future, probably using P5JS comunicating with the server through WebSocket.
